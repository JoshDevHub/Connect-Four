# Connect Four

A command line game of Connect Four. Built using Ruby.

## About

This was done as part of [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com). The goal was to build a CLI game of Connect Four and to build it while using Test Driven Development.

At nearly 130 commits, this has been my largest project so far, and I'm quite proud of it. I was mostly able to stick to a TDD style of development but definitely slipped up in a few spots. The most difficult was creating a good testing strategy for `Game`. With it being a 'script'-type class that integrates all the aspects of the app together, it was challenging to think of how to test it without any actual written code.

I learned a ton about testing and rspec through the development of this. I've enjoyed testing so far. It definitely makes refactoring much more bearable. Excited to leverage it in my future work.
